;;; Commentary:

;; A number of functions to make posting by e-mail to the
;; wordpress.com blog hosting service <http://www.wordpress.com>
;; easier.  It might work with other wordpress installations, which I
;; have not tried.  For more information about posting to wordpress by
;; e-mail see the support page
;; <http://support.wordpress.com/post-by-email/>.

;; Start a new post, possibly from the region or the buffer, with
;; wpmail-new-post, and send it with wpmail-send-post when you are
;; done.  wpmail-new-post will prompt for title and category; it will
;; propose some titles you can see via M-n, and auto-completes the
;; categories in wpmail-categories.  See the documentation of these
;; functions for details.

;;; Dependencies:
;; Message from Gnus.  It is included in Emacs, at least in version
;; 23.  Tested with Gnus v5.13.

;;; Installation:
;; Customize the variables at the top of the code section, and
;; (require 'wpmail) in your init file.

;;; History:
;; 2009-07:    First release.
;; 2009-11-03: Add post-configured-p and use it. Allow creating a new
;;   post in current buffer.

;;; TODO

;; When proposing the file name for a title, remove suffixes.

;; Add Markdown support, converting the post to HTML when sending.

;; Offer before- and after-send hooks, to allow things like
;; transforming the markup or saving all published posts in a certain
;; directory.

;;; Code:
(require 'message)

  "Start a new wordpress blog post in a new buffer.
The post will have the title TITLE and be in category CATEGORY.

The function proposes some titles based on the buffer name and
text around point, if any.  These propositions are in the
\"future history\", accessible by M-n.

In the category prompt, the values of wpmail-categories are
available for auto-completion.  You can also enter any category
that is not in wpmail-categories, but your wordpress must know
it.

A new buffer will be created, visiting the file TITLE.wp in
wpmail-posts-dir.  There is no need to save this file, however.
You can send it, with TITLE preserved, without saving it.

If INIT-CONTENT is non-nil (interactively, with prefix argument),
the new post buffer is filled with the region if it exists, and
with the whole content of the current buffer otherwise.

The new post buffer will contain a list of shortcodes, directives
the wordpress software evaluates when it receives the post. They
will be initialized to hopefully sensible values, but you should
check them before sending. In particular, you might wish to
change the post tags or the status. See
<http://support.wordpress.com/post-by-email/> for documentation
about shortcodes."
