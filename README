* About

wpmail is a helper to post to wrodpress.com by e-mail from Emacs. See
wpmail.el for more info.


* TODO

  - Decent configuration, use defvar and don't clutter global
    namespace. Or customize.
  - Validity checks before mailing? Might be overkill.
  - Post from current buffer, infer title, possibly depending on mode.
    - Done except honoring mode, and this should better be left to
      users as it will vary wildly.  I don't need it at all, actually.
  - Tests, possibly using ert.el
