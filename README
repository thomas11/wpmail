wpmail is an Emacs extension to make posting to Wordpress by e-mail
easier.  See wpmail.el for more info.  It was only tested with
wordpress.com so far, but should work with other installations, too.

It's the first Emacs code I publish. I've tried to follow the
conventions outlined in the ELisp manual; please let me know if you
find anything that should be fixed or could be improved.
